      <h1>The Furthest Distance in the world</h1>

      <p>
  The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not the distance between life and death
<br>But you don't know I love you when I stand in front of you
      </p>

      <p>
  The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not you don't know I love you when I stand in front of you
<br>But I cannot say I love you when I love you so madly
      </p>
  
      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not I cannot say I love you when I love you so madly
<br>But I can only bury it in my heart dispute the unbearable yearning
      </p>
      
      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not I can only bury it in my heart dispute the unbearable yearning
<br>But we cannot be together when we love each other
      </p>
    
      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not we cannot be together when we love each other
<br>But we pretend caring nothing even we know love is unconquerable
      </p>
      
      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not the distance between two trees
<br>But the branches cannot depend on each other in wind even they grow from the same root
      </p>
      
      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not the braches cannot depend on each other
<br>But two stars cannot meet even they watch each other
      </p>
      
      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not the track between two stars
<br>But nowhere to search in a tick after two tracks join
      </p>
      
      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not nowhere to search in a tick
<br>But doomed not to be together before they meet
      </p>
      
      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is the distance between fish and bird
<br>One is in the sky, another is in the sea
      </p>
       
      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not the distance between life and death
<br>But you don't know I love you when I stand in front of you
      </p>
      
      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not you don't know I love you when I stand in front of you
<br>But I cannot say I love you when I love you so madly
      </p>

      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not I cannot say I love you when I love you so madly
<br>But I can only bury it in my heart dispute the unbearable yearning
      </p>

      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not I can only bury it in my heart dispute the unbearable yearning
<br>But we cannot be together when we love each other
      </p>
      
      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not we cannot be together when we love each other
<br>But we pretend caring nothing even we know love is unconquerable
      </p>
  
      <p>
The furthest distance in the world
<br>Is not But using one's indifferent heart
<br>To dig an uncrossable river
<br>For the one who loves you
<br>He makes no friend who never made a foe.
