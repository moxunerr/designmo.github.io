 The Longest Distance in the World 
                ---Ranbindranath Tagore

The longest distance in the world
Is not that between life and death
But when I stand in front of you
Yet you don't know that I love you

The furthest distance in the world
Is not when I stand in font of you
Yet you can't see my love
But when undoubtedly knowing the love from both
Yet cannot be togehter

The furthest distance in the world
Is not being apart while being in love
But when plainly can not resist the yearning
Yet pretending you have never been in my heart
The furthest distance in the world
Is not，
But using one's indifferent heart，
To dig an uncrossable river for the one who loves you

The farthest distance in the world
Is not we cannot be together when we love each other
But we pretend caring nothing
Even we know love is unconquerable

The farthest distance in the world
Is not the distance between two trees
But the branches cannot depend on each other in wind
Even they grow from the same root

The farthest distance in the world
Is not the braches cannot depend on each other
But two stars cannot meet
Even they watch each other

The farthest distance in the world
Is not the track between two stars
But nowhere to search in a tick
After two tracks join

The farthest distance in the world
Is not nowhere to search in a tick
But doomed not to be together before they meet

The farthest distance in the world
Is the distance between fish and bird
One is in the sky,
Another is in the sea
