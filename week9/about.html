        <p>The disruption highlighted an entrenched problem in the New York metropolitan area: The task of moving people around the most congested corner of the United States is divided among several autonomous agencies, each with its own priorities — and interests that often clash.

As a result, in a region where the highways, bridges, tunnels, trains and subways are packed, even a minor accident like the one at Penn Station can reverberate far and wide — in this case, all the way to Washington.

Once a jewel of the nation’s transportation network, Penn Station, North America’s busiest rail terminal, is now the overburdened nexus of two of the country’s biggest commuter railroads and its only viable intercity train service. Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road combine to push and pull half a million people through the station’s aging infrastructure every weekday.
