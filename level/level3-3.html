            <p>The furthest distance in the world 
Is not the distance between life and death 
            <br>But you don't know I love you when I stand in front of you</p>
            <p>The furthest distance in the world 
Is not you don't know I love you when I stand in front of you 
            <br>But I cannot say I love you when I love you so madly</p>
            </div>

            <p>The furthest distance in the world 
Is not I cannot say I love you when I love you so madly 
            <br>But I can only bury it in my heart dispute the unbearable yearning</p>

            <p>The furthest distance in the world 
Is not I can only bury it in my heart dispute the unbearable yearning 
            <br>But we cannot be together when we love each other</p>
                </div>
        
        

            <div>
            <p>The furthest distance in the world 
Is not we cannot be together when we love each other 
            <br>But we pretend caring nothing even we know love is unconquerable</p>
                
            <p>The furthest distance in the world 
Is not the distance between two trees 
            <br>But the branches cannot depend on each other in wind even they grow from the same root</p>
                </div>
        

                
            <div>
            <p>The furthest distance in the world 
Is not the braches cannot depend on each other 
            <br>But two stars cannot meet even they watch each other</p>

            <p>The furthest distance in the world 
Is not But using one's indifferent heart 
To dig an uncrossable river 
            <br>For the one who loves you 
He makes no friend who never made a foe.</p>
