                       Since the integration of the Chi- nese nation becomes gradually intense, young generation in China and even in the world (foreign cit- izens of Chinese origin) are more and more distant with Minorites cultures.
The treasure of heritage is around us. When people see The Great Wall and Summer Palace, they may inquiry how Chinese an- cestors can have such a crystalli- zation of wisdom, and as Chinese people may be proud of their coun- try. I would like to say that Visual stimuli could give people a strong emotion. You will easily find out that the strength from human civi- lization is grandeur, because mod- ern development is based on The ancient civilization. When people respect and perceive human civilization, they will clearly understand where the historical positions they are at, and they will have aware- ness of direction of future life, technology, politics, and. it’s ben- efited for people to improve the consciousness of equality, and the communication between cultures.
We should pay more at- tention to our troditional culture heritage as the descendents and spread them across the world.
